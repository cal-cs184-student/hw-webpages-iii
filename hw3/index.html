		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this assignment, I implemented a physically-based ray tracer that simulates the behavior of light to generate realistic images. The core components include ray-scene intersection, bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) for acceleration, direct and global illumination, importance sampling, and adaptive sampling. By incorporating these techniques, the ray tracer efficiently handles complex scenes with improved performance and visual fidelity.

One of the most interesting aspects of this project was understanding the impact of different sampling strategies on rendering quality and noise reduction. Implementing BVH highlighted the power of spatial data structures in optimizing intersection tests, while global illumination with path tracing demonstrated how recursive light transport contributes to realistic shading. Additionally, adaptive sampling provided insights into optimizing computational effort by focusing resources where they are most needed. Overall, this assignment deepened my appreciation for physically-based rendering and the balance between accuracy, efficiency, and visual realism in computer graphics.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
<p>
In the ray generation stage, the <code>Camera::generate_ray(double x, double y)</code> function creates a ray starting at the camera position and passing through a point on the image sensor. The inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are normalized screen coordinates in the range [0, 1]. These are mapped to camera space using the horizontal and vertical field of view (<code>hFov</code> and <code>vFov</code>). Specifically, we compute the sensor coordinates with:
</p>

<pre>
double sensor_x = -tan(hFov / 2) + x * 2 * tan(hFov / 2);
double sensor_y = -tan(vFov / 2) + y * 2 * tan(vFov / 2);
</pre>

<p>
This gives us the direction of the ray in the camera’s local space. We then form the ray in world space by transforming this direction using the camera-to-world matrix <code>c2w</code> and normalizing it. The resulting ray has origin at the camera position and a unit direction vector. In <code>PathTracer::raytrace_pixel</code>, this function is used to create multiple rays per pixel with slight random offsets to achieve anti-aliasing. Each ray is traced into the scene, and its resulting radiance is averaged and stored in the <code>sampleBuffer</code>.
</p>

<p>
For triangle intersections, the algorithm checks whether the ray intersects with the triangle and, if so, calculates where the hit happens. First, it computes whether the ray is parallel to the triangle’s surface by checking if the denominator in the equation is zero. If not, it calculates the intersection point using the ray equation and checks if the point lies inside the triangle using barycentric coordinates. The <code>has_intersection</code> function only returns whether a hit occurred, while the <code>intersect</code> function also records detailed information like the hit point, surface normal, and material. For spheres, the algorithm uses the quadratic formula to solve for intersection points and picks the closest valid one. Both types of intersections update <code>r.max_t</code> to ensure only the closest hit is stored.

<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>

<p>
In my BVH implementation, I recursively build the hierarchy in <code>construct_bvh(...)</code>. I begin by computing a bounding box that encloses all the primitives in the current range. If the number of primitives is less than or equal to <code>max_leaf_size</code>, I return a leaf node containing those primitives. Otherwise, I use a bucket-based Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) to decide the best way to split the node. I divide the bounding box into 60 buckets along both the x and y axes and assign primitives to buckets based on the centroid of their bounding boxes. For each potential split between buckets i and i+1, I calculate the SAH cost using:
</p>

<pre>
cost = c_trav + count_left * SA_left + count_right * SA_right,
</pre>

<p>
where <code>SA_left</code> and <code>SA_right</code> are the surface areas of the child bounding boxes. I select the axis and split that yields the lowest cost. If all primitives fall into a single bucket and no good split is found, I treat the node as a leaf to avoid infinite recursion. Otherwise, I partition the primitives using <code>std::partition</code> based on their centroid positions and recursively construct child BVH nodes.
</p>

<p>
To accelerate ray intersection, I implemented <code>has_intersection(...)</code> and <code>intersect(...)</code>. In <code>has_intersection</code>, I first test whether the ray hits the node's bounding box using the <code>BBox::intersect(...)</code> function. If not, I return false. If the node is a leaf, I loop through all contained primitives and check if any of them intersect the ray using <code>has_intersection</code>. Since we can return early, this function is optimized for speed. In <code>intersect(...)</code>, I do a similar check, but store detailed intersection information (like the closest hit, surface normal, and material) by calling <code>intersect(ray, i)</code> on each primitive. For internal nodes, both functions recursively check the left and right children. The bounding box intersection function uses a slab method to compute intersection intervals along each axis and clamps them to determine if the ray hits the box. Together, this BVH structure and traversal logic greatly improve rendering efficiency by allowing early exits and pruning large regions of the scene that do not intersect with the ray.
</p>

</div>

<p>
To compare performance, I rendered moderately complex scenes both with and without BVH acceleration. Without BVH, scenes with many triangles take significantly longer to render, as each ray must check against every primitive. With BVH, rays can quickly skip over large portions of the scene that are not relevant, resulting in much faster rendering. For example, the maxplanck and lucy scenes rendered in seconds with BVH, but took minutes without it. This shows how BVH dramatically improves rendering times by reducing unnecessary intersection tests and organizing the scene geometry efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>

<p>
The function <code>DiffuseBSDF::f(const Vector3D wo, const Vector3D wi)</code> implements Lambertian reflection and returns the same reflectance value regardless of direction, modeling light as evenly scattered. For zero-bounce illumination, we use <code>zero_bounce_radiance</code> to return light directly emitted from emissive surfaces like area lights without any interaction with other surfaces.
</p>

<p>
In <code>estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere</code>, we estimate direct lighting by uniformly sampling directions over the hemisphere centered around the surface normal. A local coordinate frame is built at the surface point, and multiple incoming light directions <code>wi</code> are sampled. Each direction is transformed to world space, and a shadow ray is traced to see if it hits a light source. If so, we compute the radiance contribution using the BSDF value, cosine of the incident angle, and the sampling PDF (1 / 2π). This method is simple but suffers from noise since many sampled directions do not lead to light sources.
</p>

<p>
In <code>estimate_direct_lighting_importance</code>, we improve efficiency by sampling directly from light sources using <code>sample_L</code>. For each light, we sample <code>ns_area_light</code> directions toward the light and get the direction <code>wi</code>, distance, radiance <code>L</code>, and sampling probability <code>pdf</code>. The direction is transformed into local space and validated (wi.z > 0). Then, a shadow ray is cast and checked for occlusion using BVH. Valid contributions are accumulated and averaged. This technique reduces variance by focusing sampling effort where light actually originates, especially useful for area and delta lights.
</p>

<h3>Direct Illumination: Noise Comparison with Light Sampling</h3>
<p>
Below is a comparison of one scene rendered using importance sampling with varying numbers of light rays (1, 4, 16, 64), and 1 sample per pixel (-s 1). Notice how the noise in soft shadows decreases significantly as more samples per light are used.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
  <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_l1.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>1 light ray</figcaption></td>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_l4.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>4 light rays</figcaption></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_l16.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>16 light rays</figcaption></td>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_l64.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>64 light rays</figcaption></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h3>Comparison: Hemisphere Sampling vs. Importance Sampling</h3>
<p>
Here we compare direct lighting using 1 sample per pixel with two different methods: uniform hemisphere sampling and light sampling (importance sampling). Importance sampling focuses rays toward actual light sources, producing much less noise.
</p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
  <table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_hemisphere_s1.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>Hemisphere Sampling (s = 1)</figcaption></td>
      <td><img src="part3/bunny_importance_s1.png" width="400px"/><figcaption>Light Sampling (s = 1)</figcaption></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
When comparing hemisphere sampling and importance sampling, we observe that importance sampling produces much smoother and more accurate lighting results, especially in scenes with area lights. Hemisphere sampling distributes rays uniformly in all directions, but many rays miss light sources, resulting in high variance and noisy shadows. In contrast, importance sampling concentrates samples toward known lights, making better use of each ray and reducing noise. This leads to clearer shadows and more efficient convergence even with fewer samples.
</p>

<h2>Part 4: Global Illumination</h2>

<p>
In <code>sample_f</code>, we randomly sample an incoming light direction <code>wi</code> from a cosine-weighted hemisphere using the BSDF’s built-in sampler, and compute the corresponding probability density <code>pdf</code>. We then evaluate and return the BSDF value using <code>f(wo, wi)</code>. Unlike <code>f</code>, which only evaluates the BSDF for given directions, <code>sample_f</code> actively generates new incoming directions to explore indirect illumination.
</p>

<p>
In <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code>, we implemented recursive path tracing. We start with <code>one_bounce_radiance</code> for direct lighting. If the ray’s depth allows, we use <code>bsdf->sample_f</code> to get a new direction <code>wi</code>, transform it to world coordinates, and trace a new ray. If the new ray hits an object, we recursively call <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code> and accumulate the result scaled by the BSDF value, cosine of the incident angle, and inverse PDF. This builds up light from multiple bounces to simulate realistic indirect lighting.
</p>

<p>The 3rd bounce looks darker than the 2nd bounce which makes sense because light disperses, gets absorbed, etc. causing it to lose power and look "darker". In regards to how the final accumulated image looks, it is necessary that the bounces get darker so that the final render doesn't look infinitely bright.</p>

<p>
To improve efficiency, we integrated Russian Roulette into <code>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</code>. Rather than always tracing up to <code>max_ray_depth</code>, we randomly terminate rays with some probability after each bounce. This maintains an unbiased estimate while reducing computation for rays that contribute little to the final image. In the following, we show russian roulette rednerdings with different ray depths (1024 samples per pixel and 0.3 termination probability):

<h2>Part 5: Adaptive Sampling</h2>

<p>
Adaptive sampling is a method that helps reduce noise in rendered images without using the same high number of samples for every pixel. Some parts of an image, like smooth walls or well-lit areas, become noise-free quickly and don’t need as many samples. Other parts, like shadow edges or corners, are harder to render and need more samples to look smooth. Adaptive sampling checks whether a pixel has “converged” (meaning it's no longer changing much) and stops sampling it early if it has. This makes rendering faster without losing quality. We use statistics—specifically the mean and standard deviation of sample brightness (illuminance)—to decide when a pixel is good enough. If the pixel’s brightness is stable across the samples, we stop adding more.
</p>

<p>
In my implementation inside <code>raytrace_pixel</code>, I sampled the pixel in small groups (batches) using <code>samplesPerBatch</code>. After each batch, I calculated the average and variance of the sample brightness using two running sums: one for the values and one for the squares of the values. I then computed a value <code>I</code>, which tells us how much the brightness could still vary. If <code>I</code> was small compared to the average brightness (based on the <code>maxTolerance</code>), I marked the pixel as converged and stopped adding more samples. Otherwise, I continued. I also updated <code>sampleCountBuffer</code> with the actual number of samples used for each pixel, so I could generate the sample rate heatmap. This let me visualize where more or fewer samples were needed across the image.

<h2>Part 6: Extra Credit</h2>

<h3>Safe area heuristic for splitting BVH.</h3>

<p>
  In my BVH implementation, I recursively build the hierarchy in <code>construct_bvh(...)</code>. I begin by computing a bounding box that encloses all the primitives in the current range. If the number of primitives is less than or equal to <code>max_leaf_size</code>, I return a leaf node containing those primitives. Otherwise, I use a bucket-based Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) to decide the best way to split the node. I divide the bounding box into 60 buckets along both the x and y axes and assign primitives to buckets based on the centroid of their bounding boxes. For each potential split between buckets i and i+1, I calculate the SAH cost using:
  </p>
  
  <pre>
  cost = c_trav + count_left * SA_left + count_right * SA_right,
  </pre>
  
  <p>
  where <code>SA_left</code> and <code>SA_right</code> are the surface areas of the child bounding boxes. I select the axis and split that yields the lowest cost. If all primitives fall into a single bucket and no good split is found, I treat the node as a leaf to avoid infinite recursion. Otherwise, I partition the primitives using <code>std::partition</code> based on their centroid positions and recursively construct child BVH nodes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  To accelerate ray intersection, I implemented <code>has_intersection(...)</code> and <code>intersect(...)</code>. In <code>has_intersection</code>, I first test whether the ray hits the node's bounding box using the <code>BBox::intersect(...)</code> function. If not, I return false. If the node is a leaf, I loop through all contained primitives and check if any of them intersect the ray using <code>has_intersection</code>. Since we can return early, this function is optimized for speed. In <code>intersect(...)</code>, I do a similar check, but store detailed intersection information (like the closest hit, surface normal, and material) by calling <code>intersect(ray, i)</code> on each primitive. For internal nodes, both functions recursively check the left and right children. The bounding box intersection function uses a slab method to compute intersection intervals along each axis and clamps them to determine if the ray hits the box. Together, this BVH structure and traversal logic greatly improve rendering efficiency by allowing early exits and pruning large regions of the scene that do not intersect with the ray.
